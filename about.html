    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>
        I am a student from Michigan State University. I gradaute in less than ten days and I couldn't be more excited. 
        To start, I went to highschool at Catholic Central. An all boys school located in Novi, Michigan. After this I spent two and a half years at 
        the local community college in Livonia, Michigan. Schoolcraft Community College (Go Ocelots!) was a great place to save money and be able to really figure
        out what I really wanted to do. I had heard from a friend who went to Michigan State at the time that there was a program for learning how to make video games.
        This seemed like it would be right up my alley, as I have been playing games since I was four years old. I got accepted into this school and was able 
        to take these types of classes. It was hard and is hard, but I actually found that I really do enjoy working on this kind of stuff.
